## Implications

### Inevitability of Hard Dominance Metric Inflation
In any closed relational system with co-evolutionary dynamics, if system variety is present, variance compression of co-evolutionary strategy necessarily occurs over time.
    
    Proof outline:
    1. Co-evolutionary systems have reciprocal fitness functions
    2. Optimal strategies converge due to mutual best responses
    3. Physical constraints create right-wall bounds
    4. Selection pressure eliminates sub-optimal variants (left-tail pruning)
    5. Therefore: Var(t+1) â‰¤ Var(t) with strict inequality when system is active

### Necessity of Externalities if Strategy Variance is the Goal

### Soft Dominance Focus over Hard Dominance
